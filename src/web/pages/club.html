    <h2>I want to start a little math club in Bangalore.</h2>
    <h3>Why</h3>
    <p>
      Since finishing college a few years ago, studying math has been a mostly solitary pursuit for me.
      While I enjoy exploring new concepts and solving problems on my own, I often miss the collaborative spirit of my
      academic days.
      Back then, my friends and I would gather to discuss homework problems, share insights, and learn from each other.
      There was a unique joy in exploring ideas together, something that’s hard to replicate alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’d love to bring back that sense of community, where math isn’t just an isolated exercise but a shared
      experience.
    </p>

    <p>If I could bring a bunch of math enthusiasts under the same roof for a few hours, here are a few ideas for what
      we could do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We can work on a little problem set together.</li>
      <li>We can work on our own problem sets.</li>
      <li>We can do some form of competitive math, by deriving ideas from competitive programming.</li>
      <li>We can talk about ideas from math that are interesting to us.</li>
      <li>We can take a book club approach: agree upon a book that everybody reads, share our progress, discuss
        concepts, etc..</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’m sure more ideas will emerge once we get started. My goal is simply to take the first step and see where this
      goes.</p>

    <h3>How</h3>
    <p>
      Bangalore’s cafe scene offers a great setting for a small gathering. I’d prefer starting small, meeting at a cafe
      on a weekend.
      I’m thinking of hosting the first meetup on <strong>Saturday, 15th March 2025</strong>. The exact location is
      still TBD.
