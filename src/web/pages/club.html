    <h2>I started a little math club in Bangalore.</h2>
    <h3>Why</h3>
    <p>
      Since finishing college a few years ago, studying math has been a mostly solitary pursuit for me.
      While I enjoy exploring new concepts and solving problems on my own, I often miss the collaborative spirit of my
      academic days.
      Back then, my friends and I would gather to discuss homework problems, share insights, and learn from each other.
      There was a unique joy in exploring ideas together, something thatâ€™s hard to replicate alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™d love to bring back that sense of community, where math isnâ€™t just an isolated exercise but a shared
      experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Meetups</h3>
    <p>Meetup 1: Saturday, 15th March 2025</p>
