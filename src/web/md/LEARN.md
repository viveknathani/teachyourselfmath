This page is a work-in-progress attempt to aggregate interesting links in a systematic way. Links are grouped into different topics. The order of topics is important here. Each topic builds upon the previous one.

I assume that the reader has a rudimentary idea of the decimal number system and its common operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
