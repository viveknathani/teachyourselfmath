### well ordering principle
It states that every non-empty subset of nonnegative integers contains a least element.

### archimedean property
If a and b are any positive integers, then there exists a positive integer n such that na >= b.

### first principle of finite induction
Let S be a set of positive integers with the following properties:

1. The integer 1 belongs to S.
2. Whenever the integer k is in S, k + 1 must also be in S.

Then S is the set of all positive integers.

### second principle of finite induction
Let S be a set of positive integers with the following properties:

1. The integer 1 belongs to S.
2. If k is a positive integer such that 1, 2, ..., k belong to S, then k + 1 must also be in S.

Then S is the set of all positive integers.

### triangular numbers
A number is triangular if and only if it is of the form n * (n + 1) / 2 for some n >= 1.

### the division algorithm
Given integers a and b, with b > 0, there exist unique integers q and r satisfying a = bq + r, 0 <= r < b

### greatest common divisor
An integer b is said to be divisible by an integer, a != 0, in symbols, a | b, if there exists some integer c such that b = ac.

The gcd of a and b, gcd(a, b) is the positive integer d satisying the following:
(i) d | a and d | b
(ii) if c | a and c | b, then c <= d

There also exist two integers x and y such that, gcd(a, b) = ax + by

If gcd(a, b) = d, then gcd(a / d, b / d) = 1

If a | c and b | c with gcd(a, b) = 1, then ab | c.

### conjectures
A conjecture is an idea or statement that someone believes to be true but hasn't been proven with absolute certainty.

1. 3n + 1 conjecture

f(n) = (3n + 1) / 2 if n is odd, n / 2 if n is even.

### sequences

1. lucas sequence

1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29...

### series

1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1) / 2

1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n^2

1 * 2 + 2 * 3 + 3 * 4 ... n * (n + 1) = n(n + 1)(n + 2) / 3

1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ... + n^3 = (n * (n + 1) / 2) ^ 2
